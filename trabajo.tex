\begin{abstract}
In this paper, the aima-java project will be used to test two different algorithms, the A* algorithm, and the Weighted A* algorithm. After a short explanation of said algorithms and the 8-Puzzle problem, which we will be using as an example for this paper, we will experiment on him with different end states and weights, proving that the results go according to the explained theory. To accomplish that, we will be comparing the information acquired after using the different heuristics and algorithms after reaching a solution.

\section{Introduction}
The objective of this paper is to briefly describe the 8-Puzzle problem and to perform an experimental study of some heuristics used to solve this problem with the A* and weighted A* algorithms. It will also explain in more detail how the A* and weighted A* algorithms are applied to the 8-Puzzle problem.
The A* algorithm aims to solve the problem in a way that it always reaches an optimal solution. For that, we'll be using the search spaces and heuristics.
On the other hand, the weighted A* algorithm doesn't go for the best solution, focusing on the states that are closer to the goal.
To appreciate the differences between the two algorithms, we'll be paying attention to the number of expanded nodes, the time used and the cost, the obtained solutions, among many other things, after applying the algorithms to the 8-puzzle problem.
In the end, we'll be comparing all this information, deciding which algorithm, and which heuristic are best for the problem.


\section{8-Puzzle problem}
The 8-Puzzle problem is a widely known problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence. That is due to the fact that, despite its apparent simplicity, it can be very costly for a computer to solve it.
\paragraph{Description of the problem}
The 8-Puzzle problem consists on a 3x3 board with 8 tiles labeled from 1 to 8. The goal is to slide the tiles orthogonally to the empty space to match the final configuration. This means that two tiles can not be in the same space, a tile can not pass over another nor can it move diagonally.
Using different algorithms, we'll be searching for the sequence of movements that we'll need to go through to reach the solution, trying to use the less time of execution and number of movements possible.

\paragraph{Heuristics}
The heuristics we will be using are the following:

headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
